# Mod Jam Response
#### Ashmitha Kanagiah, CART 253


The mod-jam was an interesting assemesnt, as we got a different approach to it. We got to make a small game, with scores, an end goal, and title screens. This gave us a little peak at how game developping would be like. For me personnaly, this was a fun experience because it was satysfying to create a succesful game, all directed by me. 
  

This project was super nice to interact with. Regarding aesthetics, the titel screen and the intrsuctions were flatterings because of the background color as well as the text colors ans shapres. They all aligned well togheter as well as there is a great use of color combinstion. For the more technical aspects, the movement of the flies are nice because they dont go off the canvas, but rather bounces back when it touches the canvas. It makes it visually smooth. Also the mouvement of the flies in the title screen is nice with the mouvement of its wings.

This project was particularly interest because the shapes were all different. The flies and the frog (which is like a flying frog?) all take different proportions, and colors, which is cool to see. It is also nice how it all happens in the sky at night, perhaps even in space? For the technical part, It is nice how you need to use the spacebar to launch the frog, where the entire body of the frogs goes up and not a regular tongue from the sample code from our teacher. I did find a small bug where I finished the game and won, but when I pressed the spacebar to play again, it like refreshes back to the "times up" title screen and I cant seem to play it again.

This project was also great to interact with. The different variations are super interesting, as we can enter different worlds to play the game. The pixaled-effect all throughout the game is also very good as it is on theme because pixaled games are pretty popular. Its interesting how each variation has its own object to catch, which is on theme with the variation that you are in. The intrsuctions were helpful to get into the theme of each variation and helped us undertand which each variation meant. As for the technical parts, Its nice how the objects fall in either vertical (coins in the chinese fortune game ) or horizontal (prophecies for the greek oracle game) shape, which suits the object itself.

To concolude, all three projects that I looked at in depth were really nice and fun to play. They were all unique and had great features and aethetics to it. I got tons of inspirationb by looking at these games for future aethetics or functions that I want to incorporrate in my own works.
