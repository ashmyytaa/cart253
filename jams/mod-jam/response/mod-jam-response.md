# Mod Jam Response
#### Ashmitha Kanagiah, CART 253


The mod-jam was an interesting assessment, as we got a different approach to it. We got to make a small game with scores, an end goal, and title screens. This gave us a little peek at what game developing would be like. Creating games is for sure fun when everything is up to you and you get to customize the layouts, fonts, storylines, and functionality.  
  
## Frogfrogfrog Remastered Edition

This project was super nice to interact with. Regarding aesthetics, the title screen and the instructions were flattering because of the background color as well as the text colors and shapes. They all aligned well together, and there is a great use of color combination. For the more technical aspects, the movement of the flies is nice because they don't go off the canvas but rather bounce back when they touch the canvas. It makes it visually smooth. Also, the movement of the flies in the title screen is nice with the wings flaps that opens and closes completely. The fly changes size at random each time the frog catches the fly is good too.

## Catch the flies

This project was particularly interesting because the shapes were all different and unusual. The flies and the frog (which is like a flying frog?) all take different proportions and colors, which is cool to see. It is also nice how it all happens in the sky at night, perhaps even in space? For the technical part, it is nice how you need to use the spacebar to launch the frog, where the entire body of the frog goes up and not a regular tongue from the sample code from our teacher. I did find a small bug where I finished the game and won, but when I pressed the spacebar to play again, it refreshed back to the "times up" title screen, and I can't seem to play it again.

## Frog of Destiny

This project was also great to interact with. The different variations are super interesting, as we can enter different worlds to play the game. The pixelated effect all throughout the game is also very good, as it give a "game-like" vibe because pixelated games are pretty popular in game developpement. It's interesting how each variation has its own object to catch, which is on theme with the variation that you are in. The instructions were helpful to get into the theme of each variation and helped us understand what each variation meant. As for the technical parts, it's nice how the objects fall in either a vertical (coins in the Chinese fortune game) or horizontal (prophecies for the Greek oracle game) shape, which suits the object itself. I also like how the progress bar also goes behind, which reduces the score as well.

To conclude, all three projects that I looked at for the response were really nice and fun to play. They were all unique and had great features and aesthetics to them. I got tons of inspiration by looking at these games for future aesthetics or technical aspects that I want to incorporate in my own projects.
