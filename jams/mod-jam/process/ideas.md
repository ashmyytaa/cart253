Frog is a different color + overall different color palette for the game (pink/purple).

Tongue makes a noise everytime it touches the flys. Like a slurp noise?

Fly has a weird shape and has big wings, wings that moves alot

Fly has a different color as well, that matches the overall color palette.

Fly moves in a different patter, maybe in circles? sine too is pretty good?
