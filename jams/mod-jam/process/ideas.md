# Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog is a different color + overall different color palette for the game (pink/purple).

2. Tongue makes a noise everytime it touches the flys. Like a slurp noise?

3. Fly has a weird shape and has big wings, wings that moves alot

4. Fly has a different color as well, that matches the overall color palette.

5. Fly moves in a different pattern, maybe in circles? sine too is pretty good? or like in a spiral motion?

6. Instruction screen will have smtg like "click to start", "press any key to start", will have a color palette different from the frog game + make the intro screen interactive? with motions?

6. Scoring system can be on the top left, either in a box or like just on the background

7. What will i keep a score of? Score of each time the frog catches a bug? Score of each time frog lets its tongue out? 

8. When will the score end? maybe once it reached a certain number of bees, or like the tongue can only be let out a certain amount of times and to catch bug within that limmit?

9. can add different flying objects that obstruct the scoring system? if frog touches a bird, scores goes -1?

10. or i can add like booster items that when touched by frog, it doubles points, triples points, or even the other way aroud, it diminishes points??

11. can add dept to where the frog is situation? maybe underwater, a scenic background, i can do like a background of a pond?

12. i can add audio??? didnt learn that yet but i really can add a cute background, and like sound effects when the frog moves, when the frog catches a bug or even when like if frog is underwater i can do water sounds or like sounds that related to where the frog is situated

13. do frog's eyes that moves with the mouse, can even maybe do an animation with eyes? eyes that cllose? eyes that open? 

14. depending on what i wanna do as scoring system, the end screen will match the color palette of the intro screen

15. do a farewell/goodbye message for the end screen, displays overall score?

16. i want to put a cute crown on top of the frog's head, princess theme? princess tiana and the frog theme?

17. do like a magical, sparkly theme actually, glittery sparkly, stardust vibe for the entire game

18. Add an object to the mouse movement? like an x or like a certain object so the over knows exaclty where the mouse is headed on the screen?

19. how does the game end? i guess when the frog reaches a certain limit of bugs but for why? for its survival? to save a certain person? hmmmm

20. i can do a concept about princess tiana like the frog has to save her but needs enough fuel and for that it needs to eat as many bugs it can to become strong a healthy, i can make the frog size go up as it keeps on eating bugs? and once it reaches the max energy, the frog is ready to save princess tianaaa? i can make a whole story out of this lowkey

21. does the frog has to stay in the bottom? i can make it move no? but i would have to like draw the whole frog or smtg like that?

22. do i just do one single level of the frog? or like it has multiple screens with multiple levels, until the frog wins??

23. if i have to do a concept of the frog dying, why? because didnt eat enough bugs?

24. instead of it using its tongue to eat bugs, can it be the frog spreading a virus to bugs and flying animals and then wins if it infected the whole pond or ecosystem??? that can be another concept

25. i can do a space theme? frog in a spacesuit, space suit hat on top of frog head? and the challenge is to catch stars instead of bugs?

26. concept 




**Frog eating flies but it gets harder and harder to catch them**
