## Description

*Frog Diving* is a simple game where the user has to catches flies using the frog's tongue. The more you catch flies, the more you enter the depth of the ocean. At the end, you will reach the big treasure, which is a gold mine filled with gold. There is no loosing in the game, you are only winning, as long as you catch all the fishes and get to the gold mine!

Mouse interaction: 

> When the mouse is pressed:
- Tongue of frog expands to catch the flies.
- Adds a new fish to the background

> New features I added:

This projects allows the user to enjoy the game and be pleased at all the aesthetics and movements.
