## Description

*Smiling Lady* is a cute portrait of a lady that is smiling her qay through life. She
is radiating a positive attitude and vibe when looking at the portrait. The user is able to engage with this portait using its mouse.

When the mouse is pressed, wherever on the canvas, the hair of smiling lady changes colors. It changes from a dark brown color, to a light brown color!

Also, when the user hovers its mouse onto the cheeks of smiling lady, the cheeks changes colors as well!

The background also projects circles, mimicking bubbles, that pops out randomly onto the background of the portait. 

This projects allows the user to interact with the portait with its mouse, to be able to change and variate certain parts of the portraits's characteristics.
