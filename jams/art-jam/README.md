## Description

*Smiling Lady* is a cute portrait of a lady that is smiling her way through life. She
is radiating a positive attitude and a great energy. The user is able to engage with this portait using its mouse in various ways.

Mouse interaction: 

> When the mouse is pressed, wherever on the canvas, the hair of smiling lady changes colors. It changes from a dark brown color, to a light brown color!

> When the user hovers its mouse on the cheeks of smiling lady, the cheeks changes colors. Goes from a pink color, to a reddish color.

Animations:

> The background projects circles, mimicking bubbles, that pops out randomly at different positions, every second.

> The bow fills are changing shades. Goes from a light blue color, to a vibrant blue color.

This projects allows the user to interact with the portait with its mouse, as well as it included animations that I designed!
