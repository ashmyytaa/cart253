# Art Jam Response
#### Ashmitha Kanagiah, CART 253


By looking at the work of my peers, I was super impressed. All three works had their own characteristics and they were all unique from each other.


The Super Saiyan portrait was interesting to interact with as it has different animations and visuals that would pop out. The feature that I loved the most was the one where when you click on the canvas, the portrait is sort-of shaking and a yellow ring appears behind the portrait. You can have your own interpretation of what the portrait means when all its features are enabled. For me it looked like a normal portrait, and then when all the features are enabled, it turns to be agitated, as if the portrait was on a drug figure. The multicolor eyes are impressive, that also fits the concept.

The second self-portrait looks really good. I'm not sure if the portrait is supposed to mimic a cartoon or a figure we see online, but it looks familiar. My guess is that the student was trying to recreate Batman. My favorite feature of the portrait is the eyes following the mouse movement. It gives the user a sense of control and it's a feature that I have yet to use in my works, which I feel very compelled to use in my future projects. I also like how the background color moves with the mouse as well. The portrait being sideways is also nice.

The Window to the Soul portrait is very unique. I really like the concept. The colors used to recreate this are very good because they all follow a certain color palette, which makes it visually appealing. You wouldn't expect the color combinations would get along when you think about it, but when seeing it on the canvas, they all look very good. My favorite part of this project has to be the eyes. They were created in such uniqueness and I love that the pupil is a heart.

Overall I loved all three projects and they all radiate unique concepts. It also gave me tons of inspiration for features and mechanisms that I can use in my future works. Having to reflect on other peer's work truly helps with understanding on a deeper level how they have worked on their project, and not just the surface level admiration of their work.
